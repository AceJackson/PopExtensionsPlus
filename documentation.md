## README and the example pop

The [README](https://github.com/potato-tf/PopExtensionsPlus/blob/main/README.md) contains instruction to installation and usage, as well as a brief idea of what most of the sub-files do.

> [!CAUTION]
> The README has not been maintained in a while and carries possibly outdated information.

The [example pop](https://github.com/potato-tf/PopExtensionsPlus/blob/main/scripts/population/mvm_bigrock_vscript.pop) demonstrates how most of the keyvalues work in a practical setting.
