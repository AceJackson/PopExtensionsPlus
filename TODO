Dev todo notes
--------------
Mince:
// Invulnerability conds cause custom arms to disappear
// Need to test wave complete / wave fail / mission completion etc for attributes, make sure things are getting cleaned up
// Remove arms and bonemerged models / reset model of players when their attributes arent present
// Try to see if we can detect thirdperson to redisplay the bonemerged custom model instead of simply on taunt
// Add support for var args for missionattributes instead of a single value
// TODO: AddPlayerCond (give it some more args, like duration)
// Once varargs is done, rename HandModelOverride to ModelOverride which can either change HAND_MODEL or PLAYER_MODEL, maybe PROP_MODEL too?
// After this redo the playersarerobots incompatibility with the new ModelOverride since it also might include player models
// ScriptLoadTable and ScriptUnloadTable?
// TODO: (ItemAttributes / PlayerAttributes) fix attributes carrying over on classes for some reason
// TODO: (EnableRandomCrits) see about using abs on the condition checks, dunno if bitwise AND will eval true for negative values
// TODO: fix switching weapons removing random crit cond not working
// TODO: (ReverseMVM) For some reason the round just starts itsself when you spawn sometimes??
// TODO: (ReverseMVM) Need to fix players getting stuck in spec on wave fail, mission complete, etc
// TODO: (ReverseMVM) Fix laser on sniper for human anims
// TODO: Modify PlayersAreRobots or make a new attr for changing robot vo to human (use this in ReverseMVM)
// TODO: (ReverseMVM) figure out a better system than this weapon deploy sequence for flare and sniper,
//       the timing seems to be off or something where you can fire just after deploying and
//       not consume ammo
// TODO: Reimplement the Error system with try catch and raise
// TODO: (HolidayPunchFix) Check if we need to set m_hOwnerEnity since we already use SetOwner
// TODO: Remove reverse.nut if it isnt going to be used, ask brain
// Fix AnimatedViewControlAll camera movement
// Implement the rest of the functions for tutorialtools.nut
// Unsure of how the global moneyfix will interact with the ReverseMVM money collection code, need to test
