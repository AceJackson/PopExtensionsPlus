Dev todo notes
--------------
Mince:
// Invulnerability conds cause arms to disappear with bonemerged robot/custom player model
// Need to test wave complete / wave fail / mission completion etc for attributes, make sure things are getting cleaned up
// Remove arms and bonemerged models / reset model of players when their attributes arent present
// Try to see if we can detect thirdperson to redisplay the bonemerged custom model instead of simply on taunt
// Once varargs is done, rename HandModelOverride to ModelOverride which can either change HAND_MODEL or PLAYER_MODEL, maybe PROP_MODEL too?
// After this redo the playersarerobots incompatibility with the new ModelOverride since it also might include player models
// ScriptLoadTable and ScriptUnloadTable?
// TODO: (ItemAttributes / PlayerAttributes) fix attributes carrying over on classes for some reason
// Finish LoadoutControl once we have our own giveweapon funcs
// Change format of playerattributes and itemattributes to be consistent with loadoutcontrol
// TODO: (ReverseMVM) Fix laser on sniper for human anims
// TODO: Modify PlayersAreRobots or make a new attr for changing robot vo to human (use this in ReverseMVM)
// TODO: Reimplement the Error system with try catch and throw
// TODO: (HolidayPunchFix) Check if we need to set m_hOwnerEnity since we already use SetOwner
// TODO: (ReverseMVM) See if we can forcibly jump to the next wave somehow when firing a game_round_win

// Fix AnimatedViewControlAll camera movement
// Implement the rest of the functions for tutorialtools.nut
// Unsure of how the global moneyfix will interact with the ReverseMVM money collection code, need to test
// Make a human / zombie voices override for reversemvm and add support for giants (for robos use the sounds, for others deepen the voice pitch)
// Add the robo idle sound?
// Find out a way to remove robo footsteps when we're on blue and not a robot, maybe a think sending StopSound?
